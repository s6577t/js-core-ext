refactor and fortify global ext to become object-ext

clear up Inflection js

function MyCtor() {
  Object.extend(this, {})
  Object.override(this, {})
  Object.mixin(this, Ctor)
}

> check spec coverage
> fortify specs for override
> revise global override/extend/overwrite
> revise usage of inflection js
> write ABOUT document
>>> why tests aren't included
>>> what is included from InflectionJS and what is adapted
>>> what is included from supplement



1) extend|override|overwrite(obj).withObject|withMixin(obj2, options); return obj;
2) get rid of override(fn, fn)
3) rewrite specs for override
4) spec and rename String.prototype.squash to strip
---
5) Make a rails gem that has assets and includes augment js if the browser requires it
